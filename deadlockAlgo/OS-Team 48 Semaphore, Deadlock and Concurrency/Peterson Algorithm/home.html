  <p id="def">Petersonâ€™s solution provides a good algorithmic description of solving the critical-section problem and illustrates some of the complexities involved in designing software that addresses the requirements of mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.
    Peterson's algorithm is considered a standard low-level algorithm for two-thread mutual exclusion.

                    1.Mutual Exclusion<br/>
                    The method provides mutual exclusion for sure. In entry section, the while condition involves the criteria for two variables therefore a process cannot enter in the critical section until the other process is interested and the process is the last one to update turn variable.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    2.Progress<br/>
                    An uninterested process will never stop the other interested process from entering in the critical section. If the other process is also interested then the process will wait.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    3.Bounded waiting<br/>
                    The interested variable mechanism failed because it was not providing bounded waiting. However, in Peterson solution, A deadlock can never happen because the process which first sets the turn variable will enter in the critical section for sure. Therefore, if a process is preempted after executing line number 4 of the entry section then it will definitely get into the critical section in its next chance.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    4.Portability<br/>
                    This is the complete software solution and therefore it is portable on every hardware.
