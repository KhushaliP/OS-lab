## Description

### Deadlock and concurrency with semaphore :

You can visualize and play with the different algorithms of Deadlock and Concurrency.

1. Banker's Algorithm
2. Lock Variable
3. Test & Set Lock
4. Strict Alteration
5. Petersons Algorithm
6. Producer & Consumer
7. Binary Semaphore
8. Counting Semaphore

### Scheduling Algorithm :

You can visualize and play with the all 9 sheduling algorithm on this website.

1. First Come First Serve
2. Shortest Job First
3. Longest Job First
4. Round Robin
5. Shortest Remaining Job First
6. Longest Remaining Job First
7. Priority Preemptive
8. Priority Non-Preemptive
9. Highest Response Ratio Next

### Disk Scheduling :

You can visualize and play with the different algorithms of Disk Scheduling.

1. FCFS
2. SSTF
3. SCAN
4. C-SCAN
5. LOOK
6. C-LOOK
